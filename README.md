README
The following readme describes the structure of the R code used to develop the New Zealand Seafloor Bioregionalisation described in: Stephenson, F., Rowden, A.A., Tablada, J., Tunley, K., Brough, T., Lundquist, C.J., Bowden, D.A., and Geange, S. (2023). A seafloor bioregionalisation for New Zealand. Ocean & Coastal Management 242, 106688.

This work builds directly on the the development of the New Zealand Seafloor Community Classification for which code is available in GitHub repository "https://github.com/Fabrice-Stephenson/New-Zealand-Seafloor-Community-Classification" (Scripts 1 - 7)

R CODE:
8. Seafloor Bioregionalisation of New Zealand.R
DESCRIPTION: Classification of compositional turnover into a low number of groups representing the lowest number of groups needed to describe geographic regions that were relatively homogeneous and distinct in terms of their environmental conditions and in turn biological contents. The discrimination across classification levels was assessed using the biological data included in the GF models in an analysis of similarities test (ANOSIM)

DATA:
DF.source - data for demersal fish (for years 2070 - 2022)
Pred_1km.CMB.source √ê environmental data used at a 1km grid resolution saved as a dataframe
